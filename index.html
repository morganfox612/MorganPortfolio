        <h1 id="name">Morgan Fox.</h1>
        <p>Growing up with a mother in the technical field helped expose me to technology early in life. This early exposure led me to pursue my interests in Robotics and Engineering. These experiences helped me learn that my interest is specifically in software development, which is why I am now studying it to pursue my coding dreams. My learning has allowed me to become proficient in Python, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Java, and C++ languages. I look forward to applying my skills within the technical field and helping a company with their coding needs.</p>
