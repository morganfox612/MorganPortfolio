        <h1 id="name">Social Enterprise Pitch.</h1>
        <p>This is a Social Enterprise Pitch that I created within my BC class. The goal of this project was to chose a social issue and then come up with a solution to it. We then creted a pitch for the solution we came up with and presented against other groups. My group chose to focus on mental health and art therapy.</p>
         <p><br>Our mission was to provide an outlet for those with disabilities, develop patient and doctor interconnection, allow for more accurate diagnoses, allow patient progress to be tracked in terms of rehabilitaation success.</p>
